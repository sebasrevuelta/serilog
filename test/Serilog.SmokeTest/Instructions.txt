This project is in the solution so that you can readily test sink changes. To do so,
just add a reference to the sink you're working on, set up its configuration in
Program.cs, and go for it!

**But** - please don't check in your changes; keeping this little test harness tidy
will keep it useful and pleasant to work with.
